Deploy to Firebase Hosting

You can deploy now or later. To deploy now, open a terminal window, then navigate to or create a root directory for your web app.
Sign in to Google
firebase login
Initiate your project

Run this command from your app's root directory:
firebase init
When you're ready, deploy your web app

Put your static files (e.g. HTML, CSS, JS) in your app's deploy directory (the default is 'public'). Then, run this command from your app's root directory:
firebase deploy

After deploying, view your app at expovideosharing.web.app
